Efforts
For this task I spent approx. 12 hours effectively, 
with that the most time I utilized on route creation and displaying proper content for each view.

Challenge
The routes are handled by router.js file in which I previously defined popstate and onload functions, 
handled click events, page navigation and reload (that required webpack file update) and finally rendered 
fetched content.

Structure
In regard to file structure, I created pages Products, Product, About. 
Additionally, in order to simplify I chose to build Products page by using ProductTemplate component.
For better class distinction for classes used in Javascript I annotated them with additional "js" allowing
CSS class changes without breaking javascript logic.
Same was done with style, where I organized files for each component to has its own styling file.

Styling
The principles I followed are: mobile-first, responsive, in compliance with given style guide, 
honoring elementary UX standards (e.g. button positioning in relation to the screen-size).

Dilemmas
Considering the amount of efforts/time that routing has consumed I decided to save some time and
instead of including template language to go with template literals as I am more familiar with it. 

Side Note
Small discrepancy identified: within provided images, image number 3 (3.jpg) seems to have the same resolution as 3-thumbnail.jpg. :)
